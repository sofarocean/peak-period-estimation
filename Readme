Abstract:

    Peak periods estimated from finite resolution frequency spectra are necessarily discrete.
    For wind generated surface gravity waves, conflicting considerations of robust (quasi)-stationary statistics,
    and high spectral resolution, combined with the inverse relation between frequency and period, this typically
    implies that swell periods (above 10 s) are resolved at best at O (1) s intervals. Here we consider a method to
    improve peak period estimates for finite resolution spectra. Specifically, we propose to define the peak period
    based on continuous spectra derived from a spline-based interpolation of the discretely sampled monotone cumulative
    distribution function.

To reproduce the figures simply run the corresponding scripts. The figures will be generated in the `./figures' folder.
The data folder contains the raw data needed to reproduce the figures. The algorithms to produce peak periods are
implemented in the `roguewavespectrum` package. For details on methodology we refer to the paper.
